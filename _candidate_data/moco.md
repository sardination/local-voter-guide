                <ol>
                    <li>Help MCPS students recover from academic and mental health losses of the pandemic. This means fixing online education and planning ahead to be ready to bring students back when public health officials allow it. MCPS must reach the thousands of students who remain unconnected, enable teachers to organize in grade level teams to pre-record virtual lessons, and improve its communication to students, families, teachers, and staff.</li>
                    <li>Rebalance resource allocations, enable staff diversity, and improve curriculum inclusiveness to make our schools more equitable. This starts with a new boundary review and adjustment policy, rethinking capital spending, and goes all the way to how curriculum is adopted, how to fix the reading skills deficit, and recruitment and retention of teachers and staff of color.</li>
                    <li>Help teachers and staff deliver the best education possible to our students. MCPS educators were overwhelmed before and now educators have mastered online delivery without much support. This cannot be expected to continue without burnout. Caring of our educators is central to ensuring education quality in MCPS.</li>

                    <li>I have spent 20 years in the classroom and over a decade in academic planning and management and have taught online for seven years. I know what it takes to teach, online and in-person, how curriculum is developed, how teachers are hired and trained. I will work with other Board members and use my academic background to engage with MCPS staff to make clear, data-driven, and transparent decisions.</li>
                    <li>Knowledge of public policy and research, school budgets, and advocacy. I have clear, realistic, and achievable plans on difficult issues such as the boundary study, mental health support, capital spending, climate change action, special education, and re-opening schools. I founded an annual youth mental health and wellness forum bringing together MCPS, the PTAs, Health and Human Services, and providers.</li>
                    <li>As a first-generation immigrant, I will bring to the Board my experience managing diversity and overcoming discrimination. I represent a broad coalition of support from Takoma Park to Poolesville and from Bethesda to Clarksburg and represent the changing face of Montgomery County.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Student voice/community engagement: MCPS must fully embrace the unique wisdom, lived experience, and creative energy of our students and communities as the way we do business and the way we make decisions. We must go beyond emails and social media and reach out to include and engage families in their children's education, especially in marginalized communities.</li>
                    <li>Becoming a fully inclusive and anti-racist school system in EVERY aspect of the work of our school system. The six focus areas for the current Anti-Racist System Audit are just the beginning. As a board member, I look forward to ensuring that the audit's findings are fully implemented, ensuring that students of all backgrounds see themselves in our staff and curriculum, and feel safe and valued for being exactly who they are.</li>
                    <li>Open data, to ensure consistent excellence of all instruction and equitable access to all opportunities. We have to start with good data to see the inconsistencies and gaps in our system so we can fix them.</li>

                    <li>Registered nurse with a master's degree in public health: As we deal with the ongoing effects of COVID-19 in our school system, it's critical to have someone with medical and public health credentials on the Board of Education as decisions are being made.</li>
                    <li>MCPS teacher and parent: There's nothing like knowing the system from the inside. I've been a classroom teacher at Thomas Edison High School of Technology for 4 years. I am in the (now virtual) classroom with students every day. I bring this unique perspective to the board table to make decisions about our children. I'm also the mom of a high school senior. I've seen our system from top to bottom, inside and out.</li>
                    <li>Longtime community advocate: Experience matters. I've spent more than a decade building relationships and partnerships across Montgomery County. I headed the 42,000 member Montgomery County Council of PTAs, serve on the Commission for Children and Youth, and have worked with a number of key initiatives including safe routes to school and environmental sustainability.</li>
